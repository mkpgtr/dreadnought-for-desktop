# Dreadnought Desktop Dashboard by Manish Panda

I think it of crucial importance that I can assure in my internship assignment that this project is a result of my focused effort spanning over a course of three days. And through this Readme file, I attempt to explain how I coded the entire dashboard from scratch. What things worked and where I failed. What things I could have made better.

I am really thankful to dreadnought for giving this assignment and now I am so glad that i have one stunning looking frontend to show on my resume. It was an amazing experience. So here are the things which I feel that need to be mentioned :

-- Declaration of Originality :

1. The entire project is coded by Manish Panda(myself). However, a little help for the basic logic is taken from Web Dev Simplflied Youtube Channel to make the Search Bar on the top right side. Other code like hiding suggestion bar when input length is 0, is done by me.

--FEATURES

1. This dashboard is desktop-friendly. The layout was a bit difficult for me to make responsive and so it is not responsive.

2. The naming of the HTML tags and their classnames might not be very accurate because I started out with this dribbble mockup in mind :
   https://dribbble.com/shots/17282596-Learning-Dashboard-UI-Concept. However as I went forward with the project I decided to change things a bit and I ended up with an entirely different version of the mockup and so the initial classnames were kept as it is because changing them was breaking my whole project.
3. The About Us link on the sidebar works. The rest of them are only for appearance and demonstration of ACTIVE class Dom Manipulation to highlight active link.

4. The left and right buttons in the middle section work. They show the previous/next slides when clicked.
5. The slider section in the bottom of the middle part of the dashboard is taken from John Smilga's Javascript Course and integrated into this project. It was a great experience implementing this here in Dreadnought Project.

6. The search bar works. Type for e.g Jason Miller and it will show the results matching the same. However, it could have been more accurate if it was done with regular expressions.

7. CSS positioning is extensively used through out the project.

8. I could have used CSS variables but as I am not good with color schemes and this project was improvised a lot, it was difficult for me to change things when I had built the entire stuff. Rigidity and inability to make changes in the existing project are some of the problems faced by a beginner developer(like me).

9. THe faq section works fine except the fact that once opened, another faq must be opened to close the already opened faq. I tried to solve this problem for a long time but eventually gave up. I hope I will solve that soon.

10. I had used some random pictures in the slideshow but then thought it would be much better to keep the reviews in the slideshow. These extra images exist in the assets which are not used in the existing project. I have kept them there intentionally so that I can exactly present the process through which I went in order to come to this final look of the dashboard.

11. I could have made the project more dynamic by adding more loops with Javascript instead of hardcoding the values. And very soon I will be doing the same.
